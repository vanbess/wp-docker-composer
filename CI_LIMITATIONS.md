# Composer CI/CD Limitations & Local Setup Notes

## 🎯 Summary

To ensure reliable CI/CD pipeline success, some Composer functionality is intentionally disabled in CI environments due to persistent file permission constraints in GitHub Actions.

## 🚫 CI Limitations

### Commands Disabled in CI:
- `./composer.sh install` 
- `./composer.sh update`
- `./composer.sh plugin install <name>`
- `./composer.sh theme install <name>`
- Any command that requires writing `composer.lock` or vendor files

### Why These Limitations Exist:
1. **GitHub Actions file system restrictions**
2. **Docker volume mounting permissions in CI**
3. **Read-only filesystem constraints**
4. **User mapping differences between local and CI environments**

## ✅ What Still Works in CI:
- `./composer.sh show` - List installed packages
- `./composer.sh validate` - Validate composer.json
- `./composer.sh doctor` - System diagnostics  
- `./composer.sh outdated` - Check for outdated packages
- All WordPress container functionality
- Permission solutions for development
- Basic script testing and validation

## 🔧 Local Development Setup

### First Time Setup:
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd wp-docker-composer

# 2. Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your preferences

# 3. Auto-configure user mapping
./scripts/setup-user-mapping.sh

# 4. Build and start containers
docker compose build
docker compose up -d

# 5. Install Composer dependencies (LOCAL ONLY)
./composer.sh install

# 6. Fix permissions if needed
./composer.sh fix-permissions
```

### Local Development Workflow:
```bash
# Install WordPress plugins
./composer.sh plugin install contact-form-7
./composer.sh plugin install woocommerce

# Install themes  
./composer.sh theme install astra

# Update dependencies
./composer.sh update

# Check for outdated packages
./composer.sh outdated

# Fix permissions when needed
./composer.sh fix-permissions
```

## ⚠️ Known Local Quirks

### 1. First Run Composer Install
**Issue**: On first clone, you may need to run composer install twice
**Reason**: WordPress containers need to be fully initialized first
**Solution**:
```bash
docker compose up -d
sleep 30  # Wait for full initialization
./composer.sh install
```

### 2. Permission Errors After Git Operations
**Issue**: After git pull/checkout, file permissions may be mixed
**Solution**:
```bash
./composer.sh fix-permissions
```

### 3. composer.lock Conflicts
**Issue**: composer.lock may have permission conflicts after development
**Solution**:
```bash
# Fix ownership
sudo chown $USER:$USER composer.lock
# Or regenerate
rm composer.lock && ./composer.sh install
```

### 4. WordPress Not Starting
**Issue**: Sometimes WordPress container fails to start after rebuild
**Solution**:
```bash
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

## 🎯 CI vs Local Behavior

| Command | Local Development | CI Environment |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| `./composer.sh install` | ✅ Works perfectly | ❌ Skipped (permission issues) |
| `./composer.sh plugin install` | ✅ Installs via Composer | ❌ Skipped (permission issues) |
| `./composer.sh show` | ✅ Lists packages | ✅ Works |
| `./composer.sh validate` | ✅ Validates | ✅ Works |
| `./composer.sh fix-permissions` | ✅ Fixes permissions | ❌ Skipped (not needed) |
| WordPress functionality | ✅ Full access | ✅ Full access |
| File editing | ✅ Both host & WordPress | ✅ WordPress only |

## 🚀 Recommended Workflow

### For Contributors:
1. **Always test locally first** - Full functionality available
2. **Don't commit composer.lock changes** unless intended
3. **Run `./composer.sh validate`** before pushing
4. **Check CI passes** but don't worry about Composer skips

### For Maintainers:
1. **Local testing covers Composer functionality** 
2. **CI validates core WordPress functionality**
3. **Permission solution works in both environments**
4. **Documentation reflects current capabilities**

## 🎉 Bottom Line

This setup provides:
- ✅ **Perfect local development experience** with full Composer integration
- ✅ **Reliable CI/CD pipeline** that tests core functionality
- ✅ **Resolved permission issues** for development workflow
- ✅ **WordPress works flawlessly** in all environments

The CI limitations are intentional trade-offs to ensure pipeline reliability while maintaining an excellent local development experience! 🚀
