# File Permissions Fix Summary

## Problem
WordPress was unable to update plugins and themes through the admin interface due to file permission issues. This happens because:

1. **Composer installs** plugins/themes as `root` user (from Docker container)
2. **WordPress runs** as `www-data` user (UID 33)
3. **Permission mismatch** prevents WordPress from writing to these directories

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Manual Fix Command
```bash
./composer.sh fix-permissions
```
- Gets www-data UID/GID from WordPress container
- Changes ownership of all WordPress files to www-data
- Sets proper permissions (755 for directories, 644 for files)
- Makes uploads and config files writable

### 2. Automatic Permission Fix
- **Auto-triggers** after Composer operations (install, update, require, remove)
- **Silent operation** - doesn't interrupt workflow
- **Only affects** Composer-managed directories (plugins, themes)
- **Safe operation** - uses proper WordPress container user ID

### 3. Enhanced Help
- Added `fix-permissions` command to help menu
- Updated documentation with troubleshooting section
- Clear instructions for permission issues

## Usage

### Fix Permissions Manually
```bash
./composer.sh fix-permissions
```

### Automatic Fix (No Action Needed)
```bash
./composer.sh plugin install contact-form-7   # Auto-fixes permissions
./composer.sh theme install astra             # Auto-fixes permissions  
./composer.sh update                          # Auto-fixes permissions
```

### Verify Permissions
```bash
ls -la wp_data/wp-content/plugins/
# Should show: drwxr-xr-x www-data www-data
```
