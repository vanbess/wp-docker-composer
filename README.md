## ÔøΩ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vanbess/wp-docker-composer.git
cd wp-docker-composer

# Copy environment file and customize
cp .env.example .env

# Build containers (required for first-time setup)
docker compose build

# Initialize the environment (automatic setup)
./init-wordpress.sh

# Or start manually
docker compose up -d
./composer.sh install

# Access your site
open http://localhost:8111
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### First-Time Setup Issues

#### Permission Script Not Found Error
If you see an error like:
```
OCI runtime exec failed: exec failed: unable to start container process: exec: "/usr/local/bin/fix-permissions.sh": stat /usr/local/bin/fix-permissions.sh: no such file or directory: unknown
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Rebuild the WordPress container
docker compose build --no-cache wordpress

# Recreate the container with the new image
docker compose down wordpress
docker compose up -d wordpress

# Test that it's working
./composer.sh install
```

#### WP-CLI Commands Hanging
If plugin/theme removal commands hang at the "Running WP-CLI command with timeout" step:

**Solution:**
```bash
# Force stop any hanging containers
docker compose --profile tools down

# Try the force-remove option instead
./composer.sh plugin force-remove plugin-name
```

#### Git Ownership Warnings
If you see warnings like:
```
The repository at "/app" does not have the correct ownership and git refuses to use it:
fatal: detected dubious ownership in repository at '/app'
```

This is automatically resolved in the latest version. If you still see this warning, ensure your containers are up to date:

**Solution:**
```bash
# Rebuild composer service
docker compose build composer

# Fix file ownership if needed
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER composer.* vendor/
```

#### Container Build Issues
If this is your first time running the project or you've pulled recent updates:

**Solution:**
```bash
# Always run this for first-time setup or after pulling updates
docker compose build

# Then proceed with normal startup
docker compose up -d
./composer.sh install
```

### Quick Fixes

#### File Permission Issues
If you can't update plugins/themes through WordPress admin:
```bash
# Fix file permissions
./composer.sh fix-permissions

# Permissions are also auto-fixed after Composer operations
```

#### Reset Everything
```bash
# Stop containers and remove volumes
docker compose down -v

# Remove vendor directory
rm -rf vendor/

# Rebuild containers from scratch
docker compose build --no-cache

# Start fresh
docker compose up -d
./composer.sh install
```

## üîß Automatic Permission Management

One of the biggest pain points in Docker WordPress setups is file permissions. This environment **handles permissions automatically**:

### What Gets Fixed Automatically
- **File Ownership**: All WordPress files owned by `www-data` (the web server user)
- **Directory Permissions**: Set to `755` (readable/executable by all, writable by owner)
- **File Permissions**: Set to `644` (readable by all, writable by owner)
- **Uploads Directory**: Fully writable for media uploads and plugin files
- **wp-config.php**: Properly secured but updatable

### When Permissions Are Fixed
- **Automatically**: After every Composer operation (install, require, remove, etc.)
- **On Startup**: When using `./composer.sh start` or `./init-wordpress.sh`
- **On Demand**: Run `./composer.sh fix-permissions` anytime

### Manual Permission Fixes
```bash
# Fix all WordPress file permissions
./composer.sh fix-permissions

# Start containers and auto-fix permissions
./composer.sh start

# Ensure everything is ready (containers + permissions)
./composer.sh ready
```

## üì¶ Plugin & Theme Management

### Install Plugins
```bash
# Install a plugin from WPackagist
./composer.sh plugin install contact-form-7
./composer.sh plugin install yoast-seo
./composer.sh plugin install akismet

# Or use the full composer require command
./composer.sh require wpackagist-plugin/contact-form-7
```

### Install Themes
```bash
# Install a theme from WPackagist
./composer.sh theme install twentytwentyfour
./composer.sh theme install astra

# Or use the full composer require command
./composer.sh require wpackagist-theme/twentytwentyfour
```

### Activate/Deactivate Plugins and Themes
```bash
# Activate a plugin
./composer.sh plugin activate contact-form-7

# Deactivate a plugin
./composer.sh plugin deactivate contact-form-7

# Activate a theme
./composer.sh theme activate twentytwentyfour

# List all plugins
./composer.sh plugin list

# List all themes
./composer.sh theme list
```

### Update Dependencies
```bash
# Update all packages
./composer.sh update

# Check for outdated packages
./composer.sh outdated
```

### Remove Plugins/Themes
```bash
# Safe removal (recommended) - tries to deactivate first, has fallbacks
./composer.sh plugin remove contact-form-7

# Force removal - skips deactivation, removes immediately
./composer.sh plugin force-remove contact-form-7

# Remove a theme
./composer.sh theme remove twentytwentyfour
```

### Troubleshooting and Diagnostics
```bash
# Run comprehensive diagnostics
./composer.sh doctor

# Check container status, validate composer.json, show installed packages, etc.
```

**Note:** The safe removal method includes:
1. **Timeout protection**: WP-CLI commands timeout after 10 seconds
2. **Graceful fallbacks**: If deactivation fails, continues with removal
3. **Manual cleanup**: If Composer fails, attempts manual directory removal
4. **Error handling**: Clear feedback on each step

### Version Management
```bash
# Check available versions
./composer.sh plugin version wordfence
./composer.sh theme version twentytwentyfour

# Install specific version
./composer.sh plugin install wordfence 7.10.0
./composer.sh theme install twentytwentyfour 1.2.0

# Downgrade to specific version
./composer.sh plugin downgrade wordfence 7.9.0
./composer.sh theme downgrade twentytwentyfour 1.1.0

# Upgrade to latest version
./composer.sh plugin upgrade wordfence
./composer.sh theme upgrade twentytwentyfour

# Check current installed versions
./composer.sh show

# Check for outdated packages
./composer.sh outdated

# Get package information
./composer.sh info wpackagist-plugin/wordfence

# Check why a package is installed
./composer.sh why composer/installers
```

### Advanced Management
```bash
# Search for plugins/themes
./composer.sh plugin search security
./composer.sh theme search blog

# Check plugin/theme status
./composer.sh plugin status wordfence
./composer.sh theme status twentytwentyfour

# Validate composer.json
./composer.sh validate

# Clean and reinstall all dependencies
./composer.sh clean
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools

### Permission Management Script

For development environments, use the enhanced permission script that provides full read/write access:

```bash
# Set development-friendly permissions
./scripts/set-dev-permissions.sh
```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Full read/write permissions (775/664) for development work
- ‚úÖ Special handling for log files (666) and cache directories (777)
- ‚úÖ Proper ownership (www-data:werner)
- ‚úÖ You can edit, save, and clear debug.log and other files

**vs Standard Permissions:**
- Standard: `scripts/fix-permissions.sh` (production-ready, more restrictive)
- Development: `scripts/set-dev-permissions.sh` (full access for dev work)

### Deploy Must-Use Plugins

Deploy essential mu-plugins for enhanced debugging and error handling:

```bash
# Deploy all mu-plugins to WordPress
./scripts/deploy-mu-plugins.sh
```

This automatically copies and configures:

## üö´ Error Filtering & Debug Management

The repository includes a sophisticated error filtering system to prevent debug log spam while maintaining visibility into real issues.

### Features

- **üîÑ Duplicate Prevention**: Same error messages logged only once per 24 hours
- **‚öôÔ∏è Configurable Filtering**: Filter notices, warnings, and deprecated messages  
- **üéØ Pattern Matching**: Blacklist/whitelist specific error patterns
- **üßπ Automatic Cleanup**: Removes old cache entries automatically
- **üìä Statistics**: View filtering stats via WP-CLI

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Deploy the error filter system
./scripts/deploy-mu-plugins.sh

# Clear debug log to start fresh
echo "" > wp_data/wp-content/debug.log

# Set proper permissions
./scripts/set-dev-permissions.sh
```

### Configuration

Customize filtering behavior in `mu-plugins/error-filter-config.php`:

```php
# Cache duration (24 hours default)
define('ERROR_FILTER_CACHE_DURATION', 24 * 60 * 60);

# Enable/disable filtering by type
define('ERROR_FILTER_NOTICES', true);      # Filter notices
define('ERROR_FILTER_WARNINGS', true);     # Filter warnings  
define('ERROR_FILTER_DEPRECATED', true);   # Filter deprecated

# Custom patterns (regex)
$ERROR_FILTER_BLACKLIST = array(
    '/Function _load_textdomain_just_in_time was called.*incorrectly/',
    '/Translation loading for the.*domain was triggered too early/',
);
```

### Monitoring

```bash
# View filter statistics
docker compose exec wordpress wp error-filter-stats

# Check cache status
ls -la wp_data/wp-content/debug-cache.json

# Monitor debug log in real-time
tail -f wp_data/wp-content/debug.log

## üì¶ Must-Use Plugins

Must-Use Plugins (mu-plugins) are automatically loaded WordPress plugins that cannot be deactivated through the admin interface. Perfect for essential functionality.

### Available MU-Plugins

| Plugin | Description | Auto-Deploy |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Custom Error Filter** | Prevents debug log spam by filtering duplicate notices/warnings | ‚úÖ |
| **Error Filter Config** | Configuration file for customizing error filtering behavior | ‚úÖ |

### Repository Structure

```
mu-plugins/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ custom-error-filter.php     # Main error handler
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ error-filter-config.php     # Configuration settings  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                   # Detailed documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [your-plugin].php           # Add custom mu-plugins here
```

### Adding Custom MU-Plugins

1. **Add your plugin** to the `mu-plugins/` directory
2. **Deploy to WordPress**: `./scripts/deploy-mu-plugins.sh`
3. **Set permissions**: `./scripts/set-dev-permissions.sh`
4. **Commit to repository** for team sharing

### Key Benefits

- **üîí Always Active**: Cannot be accidentally deactivated
- **‚ö° Early Loading**: Loaded before regular plugins and themes
- **üë• Team Consistency**: Shared via repository across environments
- **üõ†Ô∏è Developer Tools**: Perfect for debugging and development utilities

### Usage Examples

# Deploy all mu-plugins
./scripts/deploy-mu-plugins.sh

# Add custom mu-plugin
cp my-custom-plugin.php mu-plugins/
./scripts/deploy-mu-plugins.sh

# View deployed plugins
ls -la wp_data/wp-content/mu-plugins/
```

**Note**: MU-plugins are loaded alphabetically by filename. Prefix with numbers for load order control (e.g., `01-critical.php`, `02-utilities.php`).
```
